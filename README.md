# SwiftValhalla
A simple wrapper for the Valhalla Routing Engine

* [Valhalla Docs](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/)
* [Valhalla Repo](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/)

This wrapper communicates through HTTP.

This is not a official wrapper from the Valhalla Devs.

## NOTE:

This wrapper will be developed as needed and on my free time. If you're missing a specific part of the Valhalla API please open a issue.
